**Topic**

This project studies hospital readmissions among diabetic patients. Hospital readmissions within 30 days are costly and are used as a quality metric in healthcare systems. Using clinical and demographic data, we aim to analyze patterns associated with readmission risk.

**Current Interesting Health Markers**

Age, Previous Admissions, number of procedures, number of current medications, diabetes medication, time in hospital

**Timeline**
- Decide which features and data points to use (1 week)
- Clean data of the features (1 week)
- Decide which test to perform/create scripts to perform test (1 week)
- Create model (2 weeks)
- Test model against high percentage of the dataset/adjust to what we need (2 weeks)
- create visuals (1 week)
- tell story (2 weeks)

**Goals**

Successfully predict if a patient will return within 30 days depending on a marker/feature

Correctly identify if a patient will be admitted with a 51+ success rate.
Create a risk profile for a patient based on selected health markers.

**Potential Data sources identified**

Main Dataset -
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes/data

Possible test dataset -  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharth0935/hospital-readmission-predictionsynthetic-dataset (Synthetic Data)

**Data collection method explained**

We will obtain the dataset from publicly available sources, primarily Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data can be directly downloaded as CSV files and imported for preprocessing and analysis.
